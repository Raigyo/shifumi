Play 'shifumi' with the computer. (It's the lizard - spock version).

It's a preparatory work for a group work at Becode.

This front-end part will be integrated in a back-end part made with Node.JS and Socket IO.

Instead of playing against the computer, two players would be able to play together, each one using his browser.
